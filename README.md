# Server_Config_chsht


## Server Configuration Management

refers to the process of systematically handling changes to a system in a way that it maintains integrity over time.

most popular configuration management tools available  
* Ansible
* Puppet
* Chef

Property              |	Ansible       |	Puppet                      |	Chef
----------------------|---------------|-----------------------------|---------
Script Language	      | YAML	        | Custom DSL based on Ruby    |	Ruby
Infrastructure	      | Controller machine applies configuration on nodes via SSH | 	Puppet Master synchronizes configuration on Puppet Nodes |	Chef Workstations push configuration to Chef Server, from which the Chef Nodes will be updated
Requires specialized software for nodes |	No  |	Yes	 | Yes
Provides centralized point of control	| No. Any computer can be a controller |	Yes, via Puppet Master	 | Yes, via Chef Server
Script Terminology	| Playbook / Roles	| Manifests / Modules	 | Recipes / Cookbooks
Task Execution Order	| Sequential	| Non-Sequential	| Sequential

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Ansible



* Control Node: the machine where Ansible is installed, responsible for running the provisioning on the servers you are managing.
* Inventory: an INI file that contains information about the servers you are managing.
* Playbook: a YAML file containing a series of procedures that should be automated.
* Task: a block that defines a single procedure to be executed, e.g.: install a package.
* Module: a module typically abstracts a system task, like dealing with packages or creating and changing files. Ansible has a multitude of built-in modules, but you can also create custom ones.
* Role: a set of related playbooks, templates and other files, organized in a pre-defined way to facilitate reuse and share.
* Play: a provisioning executed from start to finish is called a play.
* Facts: global variables containing information about the system, like network interfaces or operating system.
* Handlers: used to trigger service status changes, like restarting or reloading a service.


### Task
 Defines a single automated step that should be executed by Ansible.
 Typically involves the usage of a module or the execution of a raw command
### structure
```
- name: <This is a task>
  <module>: <option>=<value> <option>=<value> ..
```
```
- name: <This is a task>
    <module>:
      <option>: <value>
      <option>: <value>
      ..... : ....
```
 * name: task name
 * module: built-in Ansible module  e.g `apt`
 * option and value: modules variable to set.

### Playbook 

YAML files containing a series of ***Task*** directives 

```
---
- name: <book 1>
  <default_config>: <default_config_value>
  <default_config>: <default_config_value>
 .............    : ...............

## DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM (DNS)

translates human-adapted, text-based domain names to machine-adapted, numerical-based IP

## DNS Records


Type of Record                     |    Usage and Description
-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------
A record (Address records)         | A record maps a domain name to the IP address (Version 4) of the computer hosting the domain,its primary records used in DNS servers
‚áí                                  | A_obj:\<address> -> where  ***A_obj*** is an element with following fields
‚áí                                  |             ***Name:*** The host name for the record, This is generally referred to as ‚Äúsubdomain‚Äù.
‚áí                                  |             ***TTL:*** The time-to-live in seconds. This is the amount of time the record is allowed to be cached by a resolver
‚áí                                  |             ***Address:*** The IPv4 address the A record points
CNAME (Canonical Name) record      |  maps one domain name (an alias) to another (the canonical name). when running multiple services (like an FTP server and a web server, each running on different ports and from a single IP address). use CNAME records to point ftp.example.com and www.example.com to the DNS entry for example.com, which in turn has an A record which points to the IP address





```
NAME                    TYPE   VALUE
--------------------------------------------------
bar.example.com.        CNAME  foo.example.com.
foo.example.com.        A      192.0.2.23

```













# SSH
The home `~` directory holds all hidden eviroments. .ssh/  .bashrc ......
The .ssh folder contains ***authorized_keys*** thats holds authorised public keys for login, when ssh is set as default login



* To generate key use `ssh-keygen`
  ssh-keygen atempts to overide or create a default key pairs as ***id_rsa*** as private key and ***id_rsa.pub*** as public key
  if name option not stated
  Command           |     Option             |        Description
