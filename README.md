## DNS Records


Type of Record                     |    Usage and Description
-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------
A record (Address records)         | A record maps a domain name to the IP address (Version 4) of the computer hosting the domain,its primary records used in DNS servers
‚áí                                  | A_obj:\<address> -> where  ***A_obj*** is an element with following fields
‚áí                                  |             ***Name:*** The host name for the record, This is generally referred to as ‚Äúsubdomain‚Äù.
‚áí                                  |             ***TTL:*** The time-to-live in seconds. This is the amount of time the record is allowed to be cached by a resolver
‚áí                                  |             ***Address:*** The IPv4 address the A record points
CNAME (Canonical Name) record      |  maps one domain name (an alias) to another (the canonical name). when running multiple services (like an FTP server and a web server, each running on different ports and from a single IP address). use CNAME records to point ftp.example.com and www.example.com to the DNS entry for example.com, which in turn has an A record which points to the IP address

NAME                    TYPE   VALUE
--------------------------------------------------
bar.example.com.        CNAME  foo.example.com.
foo.example.com.        A      192.0.2.23
